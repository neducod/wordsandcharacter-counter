# Word & Character Counter

A simple, lightweight web tool that counts characters and words in real time as the user types. 
I built it with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript and is ideal as a learning project or a small utility to embed in other projects.

## Demo

Check it out and tell me what you think: `https://wordsandcharacter-counter.vercel.app/`

---

## Features

* Live character count (including spaces and punctuation)
* Live word count (robust splitting that ignores extra whitespace)
* Handles empty input gracefully
* Easily customizable character limit / styling
* Accessible: keyboard friendly and screen-reader readable

---

## Files

* `index.html` — markup and structure
* `styles.css` — basic styles and responsive styles
* `script.js` — the counter logic

---

## Usage

* Type into the textarea and watch the character and word counts update live.

## Features or Things to add
* I need to;
* Add a progress bar showing percent of a character limit
* Add reading-time estimate (`words / 200` words per minute)
* Add copy-to-clipboard and clear buttons
* Add theme toggle (light/dark); maybe
* Save text locally using `localStorage`
* Add live validation (e.g., prevent typing past a max limit)
* To change the maximum character limit, modify the `MAX_LIMIT` constant in `app.js` (if present) or tweak the UI logic.
